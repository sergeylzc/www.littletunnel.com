                  <h1>Psychological solutions are your opportunities</h1>
                  <ul>
<li>Most people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions, which usually have been tried</li>
<li>If you try to solve a problem with logic, what comes out of it usually is a undifferentiated solution</li>
<li>If you want to charge for a premium, you need to come up with psychological solutions</li>
<li>Some examples:
<ul>
<li>Commuter complain about trains being too slow
<ul>
<li>Logical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction</li>
<li>Psychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map</li>
<li>Psychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elevator is too slow
<ul>
<li>Logical solution: make elevator faster</li>
<li>Psychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do we increase sales?
<ul>
<li>Logical solution: make it cheaper”</li>
</ul>

<li>Net profit: what's left over after all expenses are paid</li>
<li>Lifetime value: gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer</li>
</ul>
